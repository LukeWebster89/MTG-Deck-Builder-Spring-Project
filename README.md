# MTG-Deck-Builder-Spring-Project

<details>
<summary>o	Why are we doing this?</summary>  
    
To create a Spring Boot API, with utilisation of supporting tools, methodologies, and technologies, 
that encapsulates all fundamental and practical modules covered during training.  
    
    Specifically, we were required to create a Spring Boot API using:
●	an application back-end developed using the language from your Programming Fundamentals module (Java)
●	a managed database hosted locally or within the Cloud Provider examined during your Cloud Fundamentals module (MySQL)
●	a means of making API calls (Postman) and a means of checking persistence (Workbench)

<details>
<summary>o	How I expected the challenge to go.</summary>  
  
I expected the project to go well. I was fairly confident in the build up to this week after getting to grips with the fundamentals during the training weeks. I thought that the testing would be the most difficult part, which proved to be true.

<details>
<summary>o	What went well? / What didn't go as planned?</summary>  
  
I was pleased with the overall build of my project and that it functioned as I would have liked. My postman requests were all succesful and my database could store the type of data that I wanted.  
    
Thankfully, I didn't run into any of the problems I'd planned for on my risk assessment which also made the project run smoothly.  

I wasn't able to get complete 100% coverage with my testing but I am still pleased with the amount that I did manage to achieve.   
  
</details>

<details>
<summary>o	Possible improvements for future revisions of the project.</summary>  
  
To improve the project, I could add more functionality to the searches e.g. a 'find by type' feature. I would also add more data fields which could be added to the database.
